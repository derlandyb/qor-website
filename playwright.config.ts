 * W24 — runs in the dedicated `website-e2e` container (`make e2e-website`,
 * see root Makefile), built from `Dockerfile.e2e`, never on the host.
 * That container shares the `website` service's network namespace
 * (`network_mode: service:website` in the root docker-compose.yml)
 * rather than reaching it over the Docker network by hostname — Next's
 * dev server and Sanctum's stateful-domain check both only trust
 * `localhost` by default, and this keeps that assumption true no matter
 * which container the browser itself runs in. No `webServer` block is
 * configured — this suite assumes the full `make up` stack
 * (api/website/db/minio) is already running.
